# React Phone catalog

In this project, I used HTML, SCSS, JavaScript,
React with TypeScript, React Router, React Context.


## Description
Implemented Product catalog according to [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/T5ttF21UnT6RRmCQQaZc6L/Phone-catalog-(V2)-Original).

Cart and favorites are stored in local storage.

Realized a smooth scroll for banners and item cards on the home page, scrolling by swipe and using buttons.  When the customer display size is too small and the last product card is partially displayed, scrolling is fixed to the length of the fully displayed product cards. 

Slider roll pictures every 5 seconds.

Slides and item cards are scrolled by swiping left and right.
